    <h2>Why does it need a calculator?</h2>
    
    <p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKEAVJZU1VHRK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005J2RYZS">This Amazon review by BozemanPhil</a> states "This game is rather math-heavy, so that might turn people off. The math is simple, but there can be a lot of it."</p>

    <p>At the start of each round, each player draws cards according to the resources they have developed. Each card has an number between 1 and 100, and the sum of these cards' numbers is a player's "buying power" for that round. For example, if I have cards 3,6,9,9, and 14, then I can buy 3+6+9+9+14= 41 points of new resources.</p>
    
    <p>As the rounds progress and players accumulate resources, the number of cards increases. Adding up the cards becomes tiresome, especially considering:
    <ul>
        <li>No change is given for purchases, so players are motivated to find an exact mix of cards that equal the total purchase price.</li>
        <li>There is a limit of cards that a player can hold in his/her hand. This motivates players to spend as many cards as possible per purchase. For example, it is better to spend cards with values 1,4,5,7,8 instead of spending a single card with value 25.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Early in the game, a player has less than 10 cards per round. Adding them up is not a problem. Late in the game, however, a player can have up to 30 cards. This is when the arithmetic becomes a burden to the players, and the pace of play slows dramatically. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a calculator that could do all the math for us?</p>
    
    <h2>How does the calculator work?</h2>
    <p>After logging in, a single text box is presented with a Submit button. Enter your card values in the box, and use periods to separate each card. For example, if your hand is 1,4,5,7,8 then you will enter 1.4.5.7.8 and click Submit. The calculator will show:
        <ul>
            <li>All possible totals using these cards</li>
            <li>The list of cards that yield each total using the maximum count of cards</li>
            <li>The list of unused cards for each total, and the unused cards' total value</li>
        </ul>
